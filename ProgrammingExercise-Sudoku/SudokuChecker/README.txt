To run my program cd into the SudokuChecker directory in terminal and type the command
java -jar flurryExercize.jar <path to solution file to check>

This will return an error message if the solution is incomplete, an invalid message if the solution is complete but invalid, or a valid message if the solution is correct. Source code is found in the src directory.
